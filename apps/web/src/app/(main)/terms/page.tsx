      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>3. Interface vs. Protocol</b>
        <p>
          The Interface facilitates your ability to access decentralized, peer-to-peer protocols on top public
          blockchains (the “Protocol”). The Interface is distinct from the Protocol. It provides one, but not the
          exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Company does not own or control the Protocol, which is public,
          permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Protocol enables people to do various things, such as processing blockchain transactions more efficiently,
          viewing, deriving, and verifying information on the public blockchains, passing messages, information, and
          tokens (including digital assets) between the public blockchains (“bridging”), and interacting with smart
          contract-based applications (“dApps”).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to initiate interactions with the protocol. Depending on how you
          use the Interface (a) these interactions may be sent directly to the Protocol or routed through various
          third-party interfaces and dApps. The Interface is experimental in nature. It represents an example reference
          implementation only. It is not intended to be used as a primary means of accessing or interacting with the
          Protocol.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>4. Accessing the Interface</b>
        <p>
          To access the Interface you must use non-custodial wallet software (a “Web3 wallet”), which constructs and
          broadcasts the data (“transactions”) that allows you to interact with the Protocol. By using your Web3 wallet
          in connection with accessing the Interface, you agree that you are using the Web3 wallet under the terms and
          conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 wallet. No Web3 wallet is created by, operated by,
          maintained by, or affiliated with us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or control over the contents of your
          Web3 wallet and we have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Your relationship with any given Web3
          wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not the Interface Terms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>5. Digital asset ownership and control</b>
        <p>
          You own and control the digital assets held in and bridged via your Web3 wallet. You bear all risk of loss of
          and relating to such digital assets, including but not limited to fluctuations in value.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>6. Third-party products and information</b>
        <p>
          The Interface contains references, links, and enables you to connect to third-party resources including (but
          not limited to) Web3 wallets, non-standard bridges, dApps, and other information, materials, products, or
          services, which we do not own or control (collectively, “third-party products”). We do not approve, monitor,
          endorse, make any representations or warranties (expressly or implicitly) or assume any responsibility for any
          third-party products, any component thereof, or the manner in which those products or components interact with
          the Interface. When you use or rely on any third-party products, you do so at your own risk. You understand
          that you are solely responsible for any fees or costs associated with using third-party products and that,
          unless stated herein, the Interface Terms do not otherwise apply to your dealings or relationships with any
          third parties or third-party products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>7. License to use the Interface</b>
        <p>
          Subject to your compliance with the Interface Terms, you are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable, non-sublicensable, personal license to use and access the Interface.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <b>8. Assumption of risk</b>
        <p>
          By using the Interface, you (a) represent that you are sophisticated enough to understand the various inherent
          risks of using cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, including but not limited to the Interface,
          the Protocol, and digital assets, and (b) acknowledge and accept all such risks, and agree that we make no
          representations or warranties (expressly or implicitly) regarding, and that you will not hold us liable for
          those risks, including but not limited to the risks described below, any or all of which could lead to losses
          and damages, including the total and irrevocable loss of your assets.
        </p>
        <ul className="inline-block list-inside list-disc [&>li]:mb-[5px]">
          <li>
            <b>Wallet security and safekeeping</b>. You are solely responsible for the safeguarding and security of your
            Web3 wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or password, you may be forever unable to
            access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by third parties could result in the loss
            or theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in, or responsibility for, storing, retaining,
            securing or recovering your Web3 wallet seed phrases, private keys, or passwords, or for any unauthorized
            access to your Web3 wallet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blockchain technology</b>. Public blockchains, and the technology underlying and interacting with
            cryptographic and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental, inherently risky, and subject to
            change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a particular public blockchain
            (e.g., via forks) could disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no guarantee that any of these
            technologies will not become unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or software errors, operational
            or technical difficulties, denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other problems requiring
            maintenance, interruptions, delays, or errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Network cost and performance</b>. The cost, speed, and availability of transacting on public blockchain
            systems are subject to significant variability. There is no guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or
            transferred successfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution</b>. Public blockchain-based transactions (including
            but not limited to transactions automatically executed by smart contracts) are generally considered
            irreversible when confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart contracts or be recorded on a
            public blockchain must be recorded with extreme caution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Digital assets</b>. The markets for digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to various risk
            factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. Digital
            assets and their underlying blockchain networks are complex emerging technologies that may be subject to
            delays, halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks, attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can
            create a digital asset, including fake versions of existing digital assets and digital assets that falsely
            claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be
            fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You are solely responsible for
            understanding the risks specific to each digital asset that is relevant to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bridging</b>. In addition to being an especially novel and untested implementation of blockchain
            technology in general, cross-blockchain bridging technology has historically been, and may in the future be,
            the subject of numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without limitation, hacks that exploit a
            vulnerability in the associated software, hardware, systems or other equipment or social engineering to gain
            control of the any bridge components, wallets, smart contracts or other related systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Third Party Risks</b>. Third-party products carry their own individual, oftentimes highly significant
            risks. When you use the Interface to interact with any third-party products, you are subject to all of those
            risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tax and compliance</b>. Digital assets may be subject to taxation. It is your sole responsibility to
            determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct in connection with
            your use of the Interface, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the
            appropriate tax authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Legislative and regulatory risks</b>. Digital assets, blockchain technology, and any related software and
            services are subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and other jurisdictions.
            Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the usage, transferability,
            transactability and accessibility of digital assets, bridging, the Protocol, or the Interface.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In summary, by using the Interface, you represent that you understand, and agree to accept full responsibility
          for all of the risks. That includes, but is not limited to, those listed above.

          </li>
          <li>Otherwise violates the Interface Terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A violation of any of the above is grounds for termination of your right to use the Interface. We reserve the
